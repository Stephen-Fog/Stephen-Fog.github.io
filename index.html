		<h2>About Rocks:</h2>
		<h3 id="what-rock">What are Rocks?</h3>

		<p>A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed. Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups: igneous rocks, metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks.Basalt is Earth's most abundant bedrock, and a very important rock. The Earth's ocean basins are underlain by basalt, but it is less common on continents. However, lava flows and flood basalts underlie several percent of Earth's land surface.</p>

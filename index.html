		<h2>About Rocks:</h2>
		<h3 id="what-rock">What are Rocks?</h3>

		<p>A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed. Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups: igneous rocks, metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks.Basalt is Earth's most abundant bedrock, and a very important rock. The Earth's ocean basins are underlain by basalt, but it is less common on continents. However, lava flows and flood basalts underlie several percent of Earth's land surface.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3 id="where-rock">Where did they come from?</h3>

		<p><strong>The three main ways terrestrial rocks are formed:</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock">Sedimentary rocks</a> are formed through the gradual accumulation of sediments: for example, sand on a beach or mud on a river bed. As the sediments are buried they get compacted as more and more material is deposited on top. Eventually the sediments will become so dense that they would essentially form a rock. This process is known as lithification.</li>
		<br>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock">Igneous rocks</a> are rocks which have crystallised from a melt or magma. The melt is made up of various components of pre-existing rocks which have been subjected to melting either at subduction zones or within the Earth's mantle. The melt is hot and so passes upward through cooler country rock. As it moves, it cools and various rock types will form through a process known as fractional crystallisation. Igneous rocks can be seen at mid ocean ridges, areas of island arc volcanism or in intra-plate hotspots.</li>
		<br>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_rock">Metamorphic rocks</a> are rocks which once existed as igneous or sedimentary rocks but have been subjected to varying degrees of pressure and heat within the Earth's crust. The processes involved will change the composition and fabric of the rock and their original nature is often hard to distinguish. Metamorphic rocks are typically found in areas of mountain building.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>Rock can also form in the absence of a substantial pressure gradient as material that condensed from a protoplanetary disk, without ever undergoing any transformations in the interior of a large object such as a planet or moon. Astrophysicists classify this as a fourth type of rock: Primitive rock. Primitive rock is common in asteroids and meteorites.</p>

		<h3 id="job-rock">Are they here to take your job?</h3>

		<p><strong>Maybe...</strong></p>
		<br>
	
		<h3 id="use-rock">What can they be used for?</h3>

		<p>The use of rock has had a huge impact on the cultural and technological development of the human race. Rock has been used by humans and other hominids for at least 2.5 million years. Lithic technology marks some of the oldest and continuously used technologies. The mining of rock for its metal content has been one of the most important factors of human advancement, and has progressed at different rates in different places, in part because of the kind of metals available from the rock of a region.</p>
